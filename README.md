# Add Product Form

This project contains an HTML form and JavaScript code to submit product information to the KORONA.cloud API. However, there are a few issues and areas that need to be addressed.

## Issues

1. **Submitted Products Display**: The submitted products are currently displayed as undefined in the Submitted Products section. The display logic needs to be fixed to show the correct product name and UPC code.
