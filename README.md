# Add Product Form

This project contains an HTML form and JavaScript code to submit product information to the KORONA.cloud API. However, there are a few issues and areas that need to be addressed.

## Issues

1. **Submitted Products Display**: The submitted products are currently displayed as undefined in the Submitted Products section. The display logic needs to be fixed to show the correct product name and UPC code.

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Form Validation**: Implement validation logic to ensure that the required fields are filled out before submitting the form. Validate input formats, such as checking if the price field contains a valid number.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for API requests. Display meaningful error messages to the user if there are any issues during submission.

3. **Code Organization and Structure**: Refactor the code to improve readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. Consider separating code into modules, applying consistent naming conventions, and organizing functions logically.
